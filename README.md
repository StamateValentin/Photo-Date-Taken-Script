# Photo Date Taken Script

## About

This is a python script for editing `date taken` metadata for photos. To set it, the name
of the photos are used. Usually when a photo is taken the date is saved in the name like
`IMG-yyyymmdd-hhmmss.format`. 

This is useful when you want to upload your photos using a provider like `Google Photos` that
sorts them by the time the photo was taken. Sometimes this metadata is not set by default, 
or the photo was sent/received using an app like Whatsapp. The name remains, but the date taken
is erased.

This script supports whatsapp name formatting and the usual type of name.

## How to use

Simply put the path of your folder and run the script. It will recursively traverse through
all the folders and files and edit the `date taken` metadata.
